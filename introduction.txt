Juan D. Varela Ortiz 
I am a third year junior. I switched from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science two semesters ago. I am originally from Puerto Rico and I moved to the Chicago suburbs 7 years ago. I am currently living off campus with some friends I made my first two years here. I plan to work as a sowftware engineer after graduation. I love rice and I hate salads.
